This package delivers algorithms for a camera pipeline, where the pipeline starts by reading the raw image and metadata information, and generating an output rgb image. The sections are:
(1) Black level correction__
(2) Vignetting / Lens roll off correction__
(3) Bad pixel correction
(4) Channel balance gain
(5) Bayer noise reduction
(6) Green imbalance correction
(7) Demosaic
(8) Color aliasing correction
(9) Color correction
(10) Gamma
(11) Tone mapping
(12) Memory color enhancement
(13) Noise reduction
(14) Sharpening
(15) Distortion correction

In this developing work I will add more and more algorithms.

Furthermore, several input images are provided so that you can test the code.

Link to the original algorithms are provided for further studies.
