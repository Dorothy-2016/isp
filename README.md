camera pipeline

Starting from raw to final jpg image there are multiple operations such as:
(1) Black level correction
(2) Vignetting / Lens roll off correction
(3) Bad pixel correction
(4) Channel balance gain
(5) Bayer noise reduction
(6) Green imbalance correction
(7) Demosaic
(8) Color aliasing correction
(9) Color correction
(10) Gamma
(11) Tone mapping
(12) Memory color enhancement
(13) Noise reduction
(14) Sharpening
(15) Distortion correction

In this developing work I will add more and more algorithms.
