OBJECTIVE  
==============================================================================  
This package delivers algorithms for a camera pipeline, where the pipeline starts by reading the raw image and metadata information, and generating an output rgb image.

==============================================================================   
SECTIONS  
==============================================================================  
Currently the package contains at least one algorithm for the following sections:  
=> Black level correction  
=> Vignetting / lens shading correction  
=> Bad pixel correction  
=> Channel gain white balance  
=> Bayer denoise  
=> Demosaic  
=> Color correction  
=> Gamma  
=> Tone mapping  
=> Noise reduction  
=> Sharpening  
=> Distortion correction  

In future algorithms for the following sections will be added:  
=> Memory color enhancement  
=> Color aliasing correction  
=> Chromatic aberration correction  
=> Green imbalance correction

In this developing work I will add more and more algorithms.

Furthermore, several input images are provided so that you can test the code.

Link to the original algorithms are provided for further studies.
